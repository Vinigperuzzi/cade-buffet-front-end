# cade-buffet-front-end
Front end to consume from Cad√™ Buffet API


### Motivation

This project is part of the training schedule at Campus Code in the TreinaDev program. It aims to develop skills in front end using Vue.js framework.


The front end must show a list of buffets in home page, also must have a screen with buffet details and events detail for anu buffet.

User can search for a buffet from home page and consult availability for any event, for a given date and number of guests.

### How to run

Just clone this repo and open the file index.html in your browser. It uses CDN for Vue.js and can run easily.

### API

It will consume data from the Cad√™ buffet API, that can be found on [this](https://github.com/Vinigperuzzi/cade-buffet-app) repo. The application are not online yet, so you must run it as well.


Note:


This application are developed to consume from http://localhost:3000, because it is the default port used by rails server.

For Campus Code people: 

In order to maintain the single page application, I fought my urge to make several pages, and maintain it as more reactive as possible. So, all navigation occur on the same single page, opening and closing some other views.
